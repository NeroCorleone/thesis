~~~~ 2. Theory of superconductivity -- Strucutre ~~~
General focus on BCS theory.
Ideally derive main equations needed to understand Andreev reflection and the Josephson effect

* Short theory of superconductivity
** experimental evidence, need for a new theory
** Cooper instability
** BCS ground state
** BCS mean field theory
** Bogoliubov de Gennes Hamiltonian

~~~ Framework for numerical model ~~~

* Tight binding model
** Basic idea and general concept of tight-binding methods (rather short)
** Tight binding model for graphene
** Tight binding model for bilayer graphene
