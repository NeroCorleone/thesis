abstract = {The dc Josephson effect in a superconducting quantum point contact, where supercurrent flows through a small number of channels, is reviewed. The central role of Andreev levels is emphasized which carry the whole supercurrent in short symmetric Josephson junctions including tunnel junctions. A simple intuitive view of the dc Josephson effect in a quantum point contact is given in terms of multiple Andreev reflections. The quantization of the critical current in superconducting quantum point contacts is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {The Josephson effect is one of the most studied macroscopic quantum phenomena in condensed matter physics and has been an essential part of the quantum technologies development over the last decades. It is already used in many applications such as magnetometry, metrology, quantum computing, detectors or electronic refrigeration. However, developing devices in which the induced superconductivity can be monitored, both spatially and in its magnitude, remains a serious challenge. In this work, we have used local gates to control confinement, amplitude and density profile of the supercurrent induced in one-dimensional nanoscale constrictions, defined in bilayer graphene-hexagonal boron nitride van der Waals heterostructures. The combination of resistance gate maps, out-of-equilibrium transport, magnetic interferometry measurements, analytical and numerical modelling enables us to explore highly tunable superconducting weak links. Our study opens the path way to design more complex superconducting circuits based on this principle such as electronic interferometers or transition-edge sensors.},

abstract = {Improving one property without sacrificing others is challenging for lithium-ion batteries due to the trade-off nature among key parameters. Here we report a chemical vapor deposition process to grow a graphene–silica assembly, called a graphene ball. Its hierarchical three-dimensional structure with the silicon oxide nanoparticle center allows even 1 wt{\%} graphene ball to be uniformly coated onto a nickel-rich layered cathode via scalable Nobilta milling. The graphene-ball coating improves cycle life and fast charging capability by suppressing detrimental side reactions and providing efficient conductive pathways. The graphene ball itself also serves as an anode material with a high specific capacity of 716.2 mAh g−1. A full-cell incorporating graphene balls increases the volumetric energy density by 27.6{\%} compared to a control cell without graphene balls, showing the possibility of achieving 800 Wh L−1 in a commercial cell setting, along with a high cyclability of 78.6{\%} capacity retention after 500 cycles at 5C and 60 °C.},

abstract = {Graphene has become a model system in condensed matter physics because its charge-carrying particles move at relativistic speeds, in effect behaving as if they are massless. This leads to some peculiar electron transport properties, like the one described in this issue. In a graphene layer sandwiched between two superconducting electrodes, a superconducting current flows at low temperatures. Current is carried either by electrons or by holes, depending on the gate voltage and hence charge density in the graphene layer. Interestingly, a finite supercurrent can flow even when the charge density is zero. These observations shed light on the relativistic phenomenon known as time-reversal symmetry, and on the nature of transport mechanisms in graphene.},

abstract = {We present a theory of quantum-coherent transport through a lateral p-n-p structure in graphene, which fully accounts for the interference of forward and backward scattering on the p-n interfaces. The backreflection amplitude changes sign at zero incidence angle because of the Klein phenomenon, adding a phase {\$}\backslashpi{\$} to the interference fringes. The contributions of the two p-n interfaces to the phase of the interference cancel with each other at zero magnetic field, but become imbalanced at a finite field. The resulting half a period shift in the Fabry-Perot fringe pattern, induced by a relatively weak magnetic field, can provide a clear signature of Klein scattering in graphene. This effect is shown to be robust in the presence of spatially inhomogeneous potential of moderate strength.},

We explain the monotonic limit with a semiclassical 1D model, and we fit both field dependences with numerical simulations of the 2D Usadel equation. Furthermore, we observe both integer and fractional Shapiro steps. The magnetic flux dependence of the integer steps reproduces as expected that of the critical current Ic, while fractional steps decay slower with the flux than Ic.},

The Hartree model of screening and band-gap opening due to interlayer asymmetry in the presence of external gates is presented. The tight-binding model is used to describe optical and transport properties including the integer quantum Hall effect, and we also discuss orbital magnetism, phonons and the influence of strain on electronic properties.

abstract = {We show that in ballistic mesoscopic SNS junctions the period of critical current versus magnetic flux dependence (magnetic interference pattern), Ic($\Phi$), changes continuously and nonmonotonically from $\Phi$0to 2$\Phi$0as the length-to-width ratio of the junction grows, or temperature drops. In diffusive mesoscopic junctions the change is even more drastic, with the first zero of Ic($\Phi$) appearing at 3$\Phi$0. The effect is a manifestation of nonlocal relation between the supercurrent density and superfluid velocity in the normal part of the system, with the characteristic scale $\xi$T= ℏvF2$\pi$kBT (ballistic limit) or $\xi$T= √ℏD/2$\pi$kBT (diffusive limit), the normal metal coherence length, and arises due to restriction of the quasiparticle phase space near the lateral boundaries of the junction. It explains the 2$\Phi$0-periodicity recently observed by Heida et al.. We obtained explicit analytical expressions for the magnetic interference pattern for a junction with an arbitrary length-to-width ratio.

@article{Svidzinsky1973,
abstract = {In our previous work 1 we gave a simple method of finding Green functions for an SNS sandwich. The usual model was considered where the effective masses and Fermi velocities are the same both in the superconductors and in the normal metals, the only differences lying in the values of the ef-fective interaction constants that are zero in the normal and negative in a superconductive metal. The magnetic field produced by the current was ignored. Finally, the ordering parameter modulus was assumed equal in all points of a superconductor up to the boundary. These assumptions being made, the problem of finding Green functions can be solved exactly, and afterward one may calculate the supercurrent through the junction. This problem has been considered by Kulik 2 ; his results, however, differ from ours. After completion of Ref. 1 we learned about Ishii's paper 3 and quite recently about Bardeen and Johnson's article. 4 In Ref. 3 a solution (by a very awkward method) for T = 0 K is given that agrees with ours, and the source of discrepancy in the calculations by Kulik and Ishii is discussed by Bardeen and Johnson, but their consideration is approximate and gives no exhaustive answer. The aim of the present note is to clarify the discrepancy between the results of Ref. 2 and Refs. I and 3. By means of the method used in Ref. 2 we obtain the result of Ref. 1. It will be seen that this result appears due to canceling discrete and continuous spectra states contributing to the current, so the difference of relatively large terms becomes small. The canceling should be expected from the general theorem of Heisenberg (see e.g., Refs. 5 and 6) ; its validity in our problem can be verified by direct calculations. Using an approximate method one clearly ought to remain within the same ranges of accuracy while calculating both contributions. Otherwise, large terms may remain after summing. It did happen in Ref. 2. Direct the z axis normally to the boundary between the normal and superconductive parts of the sandwich. The origin is placed in the middle of the normal layer, the width of which is denoted by d. Instead of the Gor'kov equations we shall write the equations for Green functions in a t representa-tion, 7 i.e., use the lowered order equations, in which it is taken into account that the essential momenta are near to the Fermi momentum Po.

abstract = {By combining the Dirac equation of relativistic quantum mechanics with the Bogoliubov-De Gennes equation of superconductivity we investigate the electron-hole conversion at a normal-metal--superconductor interface in graphene. We find that the Andreev reflection of Dirac fermions has several unusual features: 1) The electron and hole occupy different valleys of the band structure; 2) At normal incidence the electron-hole conversion happens with unit efficiency in spite of the large mismatch in Fermi wave lengths at the two sides of the interface; and, most fundamentally: 3) Away from normal incidence the reflection angle may be the same as the angle of incidence (retro-reflection) or it may be inverted (specular reflection). Specular Andreev reflection dominates in weakly doped graphene, when the Fermi wave length in the normal region is large compared to the superconducting coherence length. We find that the transition from retro-reflection to specular reflection with decreasing doping is associated with an inversion of the voltage dependence of the subgap conductance of the interface.},
