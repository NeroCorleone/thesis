abstract = {We present a theory of quantum-coherent transport through a lateral p-n-p structure in graphene, which fully accounts for the interference of forward and backward scattering on the p-n interfaces. The backreflection amplitude changes sign at zero incidence angle because of the Klein phenomenon, adding a phase {\$}\backslashpi{\$} to the interference fringes. The contributions of the two p-n interfaces to the phase of the interference cancel with each other at zero magnetic field, but become imbalanced at a finite field. The resulting half a period shift in the Fabry-Perot fringe pattern, induced by a relatively weak magnetic field, can provide a clear signature of Klein scattering in graphene. This effect is shown to be robust in the presence of spatially inhomogeneous potential of moderate strength.},

abstract = {We have measured the critical current dependence on the magnetic flux of two long SNS junctions differing by the normal wire geometry. The samples are made by a Au wire connected to W contacts, via Focused Ion Beam assisted deposition. We could tune the magnetic pattern from the monotonic gaussian-like decay of a quasi 1D normal wire to the Fraunhofer-like pattern of a square normal wire. We explain the monotonic limit with a semiclassical 1D model, and we fit both field dependences with numerical simulations of the 2D Usadel equation. Furthermore, we observe both integer and fractional Shapiro steps. The magnetic flux dependence of the integer steps reproduces as expected that of the critical current Ic, while fractional steps decay slower with the flux than Ic.},

The Hartree model of screening and band-gap opening due to interlayer asymmetry in the presence of external gates is presented. The tight-binding model is used to describe optical and transport properties including the integer quantum Hall effect, and we also discuss orbital magnetism, phonons and the influence of strain on electronic properties.

abstract = {We show that in ballistic mesoscopic SNS junctions the period of critical current versus magnetic flux dependence (magnetic interference pattern), Ic($\Phi$), changes continuously and nonmonotonically from $\Phi$0to 2$\Phi$0as the length-to-width ratio of the junction grows, or temperature drops. In diffusive mesoscopic junctions the change is even more drastic, with the first zero of Ic($\Phi$) appearing at 3$\Phi$0. The effect is a manifestation of nonlocal relation between the supercurrent density and superfluid velocity in the normal part of the system, with the characteristic scale $\xi$T= ℏvF2$\pi$kBT (ballistic limit) or $\xi$T= √ℏD/2$\pi$kBT (diffusive limit), the normal metal coherence length, and arises due to restriction of the quasiparticle phase space near the lateral boundaries of the junction. It explains the 2$\Phi$0-periodicity recently observed by Heida et al.. We obtained explicit analytical expressions for the magnetic interference pattern for a junction with an arbitrary length-to-width ratio. Experiments are proposed to directly observe the $\Phi$0→2$\Phi$0- and $\Phi$0→3$\Phi$0-transitions.},

abstract = {We investigate the Josephson critical current {\$}I{\_}c(\backslashPhi){\$} of a wide superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SNS) junction as a function of the magnetic flux {\$}\backslashPhi{\$} threading it. Electronic trajectories reflected from the side edges alter the function {\$}I{\_}c(\backslashPhi){\$} as compared to the conventional Fraunhofer-type dependence. At weak magnetic fields, {\$}B\backslashlesssim \backslashPhi{\_}0/d{\^{}}2{\$}, the edge effect lifts zeros in {\$}I{\_}c(\backslashPhi){\$} and gradually shifts the minima of that function toward half-integer multiples of the flux quantum. At {\$}B{\textgreater}\backslashPhi{\_}0/d{\^{}}2{\$}, the edge effect leads to an accelerated decay of the critical current {\$}I{\_}c(\backslashPhi){\$} with increasing {\$}\backslashPhi{\$}. At larger fields, eventually, the system is expected to cross into a regime of "classical" mesoscopic fluctuations that is specific for wide ballistic SNS junctions with rough edges.},

@article{Svidzinsky1973,
abstract = {In our previous work 1 we gave a simple method of finding Green functions for an SNS sandwich. The usual model was considered where the effective masses and Fermi velocities are the same both in the superconductors and in the normal metals, the only differences lying in the values of the ef-fective interaction constants that are zero in the normal and negative in a superconductive metal. The magnetic field produced by the current was ignored. Finally, the ordering parameter modulus was assumed equal in all points of a superconductor up to the boundary. These assumptions being made, the problem of finding Green functions can be solved exactly, and afterward one may calculate the supercurrent through the junction. This problem has been considered by Kulik 2 ; his results, however, differ from ours. After completion of Ref. 1 we learned about Ishii's paper 3 and quite recently about Bardeen and Johnson's article. 4 In Ref. 3 a solution (by a very awkward method) for T = 0 K is given that agrees with ours, and the source of discrepancy in the calculations by Kulik and Ishii is discussed by Bardeen and Johnson, but their consideration is approximate and gives no exhaustive answer. The aim of the present note is to clarify the discrepancy between the results of Ref. 2 and Refs. I and 3. By means of the method used in Ref. 2 we obtain the result of Ref. 1. It will be seen that this result appears due to canceling discrete and continuous spectra states contributing to the current, so the difference of relatively large terms becomes small. The canceling should be expected from the general theorem of Heisenberg (see e.g., Refs. 5 and 6) ; its validity in our problem can be verified by direct calculations. Using an approximate method one clearly ought to remain within the same ranges of accuracy while calculating both contributions. Otherwise, large terms may remain after summing. It did happen in Ref. 2. Direct the z axis normally to the boundary between the normal and superconductive parts of the sandwich. The origin is placed in the middle of the normal layer, the width of which is denoted by d. Instead of the Gor'kov equations we shall write the equations for Green functions in a t representa-tion, 7 i.e., use the lowered order equations, in which it is taken into account that the essential momenta are near to the Fermi momentum Po. These equations are lie) + i(d/dt)]G{\~{}}+)(x, t, t') + A(tvox)Fo,(x , t, t') = 6(t -t')},
