This is the analog of the quantized conductance of a point contact in the normal state. It is essential that the constriction is short compared to the superconducting coherence length.},

abstract = {We show that in ballistic mesoscopic SNS junctions the period of critical current versus magnetic flux dependence (magnetic interference pattern), Ic($\Phi$), changes continuously and nonmonotonically from $\Phi$0to 2$\Phi$0as the length-to-width ratio of the junction grows, or temperature drops. In diffusive mesoscopic junctions the change is even more drastic, with the first zero of Ic($\Phi$) appearing at 3$\Phi$0. The effect is a manifestation of nonlocal relation between the supercurrent density and superfluid velocity in the normal part of the system, with the characteristic scale $\xi$T= ℏvF2$\pi$kBT (ballistic limit) or $\xi$T= √ℏD/2$\pi$kBT (diffusive limit), the normal metal coherence length, and arises due to restriction of the quasiparticle phase space near the lateral boundaries of the junction. It explains the 2$\Phi$0-periodicity recently observed by Heida et al.. We obtained explicit analytical expressions for the magnetic interference pattern for a junction with an arbitrary length-to-width ratio. Experiments are proposed to directly observe the $\Phi$0→2$\Phi$0- and $\Phi$0→3$\Phi$0-transitions.},

@article{Svidzinsky1973,
abstract = {In our previous work 1 we gave a simple method of finding Green functions for an SNS sandwich. The usual model was considered where the effective masses and Fermi velocities are the same both in the superconductors and in the normal metals, the only differences lying in the values of the ef-fective interaction constants that are zero in the normal and negative in a superconductive metal. The magnetic field produced by the current was ignored. Finally, the ordering parameter modulus was assumed equal in all points of a superconductor up to the boundary. These assumptions being made, the problem of finding Green functions can be solved exactly, and afterward one may calculate the supercurrent through the junction. This problem has been considered by Kulik 2 ; his results, however, differ from ours. After completion of Ref. 1 we learned about Ishii's paper 3 and quite recently about Bardeen and Johnson's article. 4 In Ref. 3 a solution (by a very awkward method) for T = 0 K is given that agrees with ours, and the source of discrepancy in the calculations by Kulik and Ishii is discussed by Bardeen and Johnson, but their consideration is approximate and gives no exhaustive answer. The aim of the present note is to clarify the discrepancy between the results of Ref. 2 and Refs. I and 3. By means of the method used in Ref. 2 we obtain the result of Ref. 1. It will be seen that this result appears due to canceling discrete and continuous spectra states contributing to the current, so the difference of relatively large terms becomes small. The canceling should be expected from the general theorem of Heisenberg (see e.g., Refs. 5 and 6) ; its validity in our problem can be verified by direct calculations. Using an approximate method one clearly ought to remain within the same ranges of accuracy while calculating both contributions. Otherwise, large terms may remain after summing. It did happen in Ref. 2. Direct the z axis normally to the boundary between the normal and superconductive parts of the sandwich. The origin is placed in the middle of the normal layer, the width of which is denoted by d. Instead of the Gor'kov equations we shall write the equations for Green functions in a t representa-tion, 7 i.e., use the lowered order equations, in which it is taken into account that the essential momenta are near to the Fermi momentum Po.

Motivated by this experiment we theoretically study the differential conductance across a BLG/SC interface at the continuous transition from high to ultra-low Fermi energies {\$}E{\_}{\{}F{\}}{\$} in BLG. Using the Bogoliubov-deGennes equations and the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism we derive analytical expressions for the differential conductance across the BLG/SC interface.

Our results show that, in contrast to the retro-Andreev reflection suppressed by the spin orbit interaction (SOI), the specular Andreev reflection (SAR) can be enhanced largely by the SOI. Moreover, the Fabry–Perot interferences in the barrier region lead to the oscillating feature of the tunneling conductance. It is anticipated to apply the qualitative different results to diagnose the SAR in single layer graphene in the presence of both kinds of the SOI.},

abstract = {By combining the Dirac equation of relativistic quantum mechanics with the Bogoliubov-De Gennes equation of superconductivity we investigate the electron-hole conversion at a normal-metal--superconductor interface in graphene. We find that the Andreev reflection of Dirac fermions has several unusual features: 1) The electron and hole occupy different valleys of the band structure; 2) At normal incidence the electron-hole conversion happens with unit efficiency in spite of the large mismatch in Fermi wave lengths at the two sides of the interface; and, most fundamentally: 3) Away from normal incidence the reflection angle may be the same as the angle of incidence (retro-reflection) or it may be inverted (specular reflection). Specular Andreev reflection dominates in weakly doped graphene, when the Fermi wave length in the normal region is large compared to the superconducting coherence length. We find that the transition from retro-reflection to specular reflection with decreasing doping is associated with an inversion of the voltage dependence of the subgap conductance of the interface.},
