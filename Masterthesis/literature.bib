abstract = {Based on the Dirac–Bogoliubov–de Gennes equation, the chirality-resolved transport properties through a ballistic graphene-based superconducting heterojunction with both the Rashba and the Dresselhaus spin orbit interaction have been investigated. Our results show that, in contrast to the retro-Andreev reflection suppressed by the spin orbit interaction (SOI), the specular Andreev reflection (SAR) can be enhanced largely by the SOI. Moreover, the Fabry–Perot interferences in the barrier region lead to the oscillating feature of the tunneling conductance. It is anticipated to apply the qualitative different results to diagnose the SAR in single layer graphene in the presence of both kinds of the SOI.},

@article{Beenakker2006,
abstract = {By combining the Dirac equation of relativistic quantum mechanics with the Bogoliubov-De Gennes equation of superconductivity we investigate the electron-hole conversion at a normal-metal--superconductor interface in graphene. We find that the Andreev reflection of Dirac fermions has several unusual features: 1) The electron and hole occupy different valleys of the band structure; 2) At normal incidence the electron-hole conversion happens with unit efficiency in spite of the large mismatch in Fermi wave lengths at the two sides of the interface; and, most fundamentally: 3) Away from normal incidence the reflection angle may be the same as the angle of incidence (retro-reflection) or it may be inverted (specular reflection). Specular Andreev reflection dominates in weakly doped graphene, when the Fermi wave length in the normal region is large compared to the superconducting coherence length. We find that the transition from retro-reflection to specular reflection with decreasing doping is associated with an inversion of the voltage dependence of the subgap conductance of the interface.},

@article{Efetov2016,
abstract = {Ongoing experimental progress in the preparation of ultra-clean graphene/superconductor (SC) interfaces enabled the recent observation of specular interband Andreev reflections (AR) at bilayer graphene (BLG)/NbSe{\$}{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\$} van der Waals interfaces [Nature Physics 12, (2016)]. Motivated by this experiment we theoretically study the differential conductance across a BLG/SC interface at the continuous transition from high to ultra-low Fermi energies {\$}E{\_}{\{}F{\}}{\$} in BLG. Using the Bogoliubov-deGennes equations and the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism we derive analytical expressions for the differential conductance across the BLG/SC interface. We find a characteristic signature of the cross-over from intra-band retro- (high {\$}E{\_}{\{}F{\}}{\$}) to inter-band specular (low {\$}E{\_}{\{}F{\}}{\$}) ARs, that manifests itself in a strongly suppressed interfacial conductance when the excitation energy {\$}|\backslashvarepsilon |=|E{\_}{\{}F{\}}|{\textless}\backslashDelta {\$} (the SC gap). The sharpness of these conductance dips is strongly dependent on the size of the potential step at the BLG/SC interface {\$}U{\_}{\{}0{\}}{\$}.},
