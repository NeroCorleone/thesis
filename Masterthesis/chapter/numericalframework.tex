\section{Tight binding model for graphene}

Tight binding models are simple, yet powerful methods to calculate the electronic band structure of a crystal or a system consisting of many lattice sites. The fundamental idea is to approximate the electronic wave function as overlap between atomic wave functions. The atomic wavefunctions give a set of eigenfunctions for the Hamiltonian.
The solution to the Schr√∂dinger equation is approximated as a linear combination of atomic orbitals.

What should be included?
* Difference electronic, atomic wavefunctions?
* Equations that describe this
* Energy in tight binding model
* Matrix elements calculation
* Hopping terms
